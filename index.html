    <p>
        Mathematics is the basis of everything including 
        software development. A good percentage of programming
        languages depend on Mathematics as a basis for their structure.
        This shows that Mathematics is key in our daily lives.

    <h2>THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF MATHEMATICS</h2>
    <p>
        Mathematics is divided into three main parts. These are:

    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li>Pure Mathematics</li>
            <li>Applied Mathematics</li>
            <li>Statistics</li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
        
    <section id="pure maths">
        <h3>Pure Mathematics</h3>
            <p>
                This is basically the theory of Mathematics. Most people shy away from this
                branch of Mathematics because it can be a bit challenging. it includes content like:
                <ul>
                    <li>Discrete Mathematics</li>
                    <li>Linear Algebra</li>
                    <li>Number Theory</li>
                    <li>Real Analysis</li>
                </ul>
                It defines Mathematics in detail and why we accept it as it is. It's the reasoning behind 
                Mathematics.

    <section id="applied maths">
        <h3>Applied Mathematics</h3>
        <p>
            This branch defines the applications of Mathematics in our
            day-to-day lives. It is a bit fun because this is where most calculations
            and formulas appear. It includes subjects like:
            <ol>
                <li>Fluid Mechanics</li>
                <li>Differential Geometry</li>
                <li>Partial Differential Equations</li>
                <li>Ordinary Differential Equations</li>
                <li>Analytical Applied Mathematics</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
    </section>

    <section id="stats">
        <h3>Statistics</h3>
        <p>
            This is where the Analytical part of Mathematics comes in.
            Statistics is very broad. It includes aspects like:
            <ul>
                <li>Regression Modelling</li>
                <li>Probability and Statistics</li>
                <li>Design and Analysis of Sample Surveys</li>
                <li>Theory of Estimation</li>
                <li>Test of Hypothesis</li>
            </ul>
